# 📊 Sales Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on sales transaction data to uncover **trends, patterns, and insights**.  
It combines **statistical summaries** with **visual storytelling** to better understand customer demographics, pricing, and relationships between different sales metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 📂 Understand the structure and characteristics of the sales dataset  
- 📉 Analyze numerical features (e.g., `Unit_Cost`) using descriptive statistics and plots  
- 🧩 Explore categorical variables (e.g., `Age_Group`) to identify dominant segments  
- 🔗 Investigate relationships between numerical variables through correlation analysis  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The analysis uses an Excel file, `sales_data.xlsx`, containing:  
- **Numerical fields** → Unit Cost, Revenue, Quantity Sold, etc.  
- **Categorical fields** → Age Group, Product Category, etc.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
| Purpose                | Tools / Libraries |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Data Manipulation      | `pandas`, `numpy` |
| Data Visualization     | `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| Interactive Analysis   | Jupyter Notebook  |

## 📊 Methodology  
1. **Data Import & Inspection**  
   - Loaded data from Excel with `pandas`  
   - Checked structure, data types, and missing values  

2. **Numerical Analysis**  
   - Computed descriptive statistics  
   - Plotted boxplots, density plots (with mean/median), and histograms  

3. **Categorical Analysis**  
   - Counted category frequencies  
   - Visualized with pie charts and bar graphs  

4. **Relationship Analysis**  
   - Calculated correlation matrix  
   - Created heatmaps to identify strong correlations  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Certain **age groups dominate sales transactions**, showing clear target demographics  
- **Unit cost distribution** reveals pricing skewness, hinting at potential strategy adjustments  
- Strong correlations between variables can support **predictive modeling**
